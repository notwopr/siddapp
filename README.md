# The Sidd App

Sidd is an app where you can create pressable buttons, a layout of several buttons (a button map), or a sequence (a feature that connects existing button maps together).  By designing a sequence, you can control what happens when a button is pressed — whether it leads to another button map or not.  

Sidd is perfect for situations where someone needs to communicate but speaking or typing is difficult or impossible. The app's features allow for creating and managing custom button layouts and sequences, tracking usage, and ensuring privacy by keeping all data on the user's device.

## Features

- **Create Custom Pressable Button Layouts**: Design layouts called Button Maps.
- **Design Decision Trees**: Create "Sequences" where pressing a button leads the user to another button map.
- **Save Multiple Button Maps and Sequences**: Keep different configurations and sequences for various needs.
- **Toggle Button Sounds**: Enable or disable sounds for button presses.
- **Track Button Press Activity**: Monitor button presses by time and location.
- **Download Activity Data**: Export activity data to a CSV file for data analysis.
- **Privacy**: All your data is stored locally on your phone, ensuring no privacy concerns.
